# time-it-python
This Python code measures the time it takes to execute a function. It uses the time module to get the current time in seconds since the epoch (January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 UTC). Then, it subtracts the start time from the end time to get the elapsed time. The code is easy to use and accurate.
